# Welcome to the Google Antigravity IDE

This document outlines the development philosophy for working on your project within this unique, cloud-native environment. Unlike traditional local development, the Antigravity IDE is designed to eliminate friction and let you focus purely on building great features.

## Core Principles of Antigravity Development

### 1. Zero Local Setup

There is nothing to install, configure, or manage on your local machine. This entire workspace is your development environment.

*   **No Cloning:** You are always working on the "master" branch. There is no need to clone repositories from GitHub or any other source.
*   **No `npm install`:** Any packages I add to `package.json` are automatically and instantly available. You never need to run package management commands.
*   **No Environment Variables:** All necessary configurations, including API keys and Firebase settings, are managed within this environment.

### 2. Instantaneous Deployment Model

Think of every change as a direct commit and deployment.

*   **Live Codebase:** When I apply changes to the code, those changes are instantly live within this workspace. There is no separate "build" or "deploy" step for you to manage.
*   **The "Final Audit":** My "final audit" confirmations signify that a set of changes is complete, tested, and effectively "deployed" within our shared environment.

### 3. The AI as Your IDE

Your primary interface for making code changes is through our conversation. I am not just a chatbot; I am the core of your Integrated Development Environment.

*   **Declarative Programming:** You declare what you want to achieve (e.g., "add a new feature," "fix this bug"), and I translate that into the necessary code changes.
*   **Automated Tooling:** I have direct access to tools for file editing, project configuration, and backend service provisioning. The `<changes>` blocks you see are my direct instructions to the underlying file system.

### 4. How to "Migrate" Locally

The migration to Antigravity is a change in mindset, not a technical process. "Migrating locally" means fully embracing these principles:

1.  **Trust the Environment:** All the tools you need are here. Resist the urge to think about local file paths or command-line tools.
2.  **Communicate Your Intent:** Focus on describing the "what" and the "why." I will handle the "how."
3.  **Review the Plan:** Before I make changes, I will always outline my plan. Your role is to review and approve this plan.
