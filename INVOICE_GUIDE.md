# Guide to Invoicing & GST on CCTV Job Connect

This guide explains how invoices are generated on the platform, especially concerning Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is crucial for both Job Givers and Installers to understand these details for proper accounting and tax compliance.

**Disclaimer:** CCTV Job Connect is a marketplace facilitator. We provide the tools to generate compliant invoices based on the data provided. However, the ultimate responsibility for collecting and remitting the correct GST to the government lies with the **Installer** (the service provider).

## 1. When is an Invoice Generated?

An official invoice is automatically generated under the following conditions:
1.  The Job Giver has checked the "GST Invoice Required" box when posting the job.
2.  The job has been successfully marked as "Completed" by the Installer.

Once generated, the invoice can be viewed and downloaded by both the Job Giver and the awarded Installer from the Job Detail page.

## 2. Structure of the Invoice (with GST Example)

The most important concept to understand is that the **total value of the service** includes both the final bid amount and any travel tip offered. Both components are subject to GST.

Let's take a detailed example:

-   **Bid Amount Won by Installer:** ₹10,000
-   **Travel Tip Offered by Job Giver:** ₹1,000
-   **Assumed GST Rate:** 18% (This is an example rate. The installer must apply the rate applicable to their services.)

### How the Invoice is Structured:

The invoice will clearly list each component of the transaction value.

| Description                     | SAC Code | Taxable Amount |
| ------------------------------- | :------: | -------------: |
| Main Service (Bid Amount)       |   9954   |    ₹10,000.00  |
| Travel & Convenience Allowance  |   9954   |     ₹1,000.00  |
| **Subtotal**                    |          |    **₹11,000.00**  |

---

### How GST is Calculated on the Invoice:

GST is calculated on the **total taxable value (Subtotal)**.

| Description      | Amount         |
| ---------------- | --------------:|
| **Subtotal**     | **₹11,000.00** |
| CGST @ 9%        |       ₹990.00  |
| SGST @ 9%        |       ₹990.00  |
| **Grand Total**  | **₹12,980.00** |

*(Note: IGST would apply for inter-state services, but the principle remains the same. The invoice total reflects the full amount including taxes.)*

## 3. Key Takeaways for Each Role

### For Installers (Service Providers)

*   **Your Responsibility:** You are responsible for collecting and remitting GST on the **entire amount** you receive from the Job Giver (`Bid Amount + Travel Tip`).
*   **Platform Fees:** The commission you pay to CCTV Job Connect is a separate transaction. The platform will provide you with an invoice for that service, on which we charge GST. This is an input cost for your business.
*   **Your GSTIN:** Ensure your GSTIN is correctly entered in your profile. It will be automatically added to the invoices generated for your completed jobs.

### For Job Givers (Service Recipients)

*   **Total Cost:** The total amount you pay is the `Bid Amount + Platform Fee + Travel Tip`. The final invoice you receive from the Installer will be for the `Bid Amount + Travel Tip + Applicable GST`.
*   **Input Tax Credit (ITC):** If you are a registered business, you can claim ITC on the GST paid, based on the invoice provided by the Installer. Ensure you have selected the "GST Invoice Required" option when posting a job.
*   **Your GSTIN:** Ensure your GSTIN is correctly entered in your profile to have it automatically included on the invoices you receive, which is mandatory for claiming ITC.

By structuring the invoice this way, we ensure transparency and provide a clear, compliant document for your financial records.
