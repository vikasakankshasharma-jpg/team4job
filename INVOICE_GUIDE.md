# Guide to Invoicing & GST on CCTV Job Connect

This guide explains how invoices are generated on the platform, especially concerning Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is crucial for both Job Givers and Installers to understand these details for proper accounting and tax compliance.

**Disclaimer:** CCTV Job Connect is a marketplace facilitator. We provide the tools to generate compliant invoices based on the data provided. However, the ultimate responsibility for collecting and remitting the correct GST to the government lies with the **Installer** (the service provider) for their services, and with the **Platform** for its commission fees.

## 1. The Complete Financial Workflow: A Detailed Example

To understand the flow of money and invoices, let's use a clear example with specific figures.

**Scenario:**
*   A Job Giver posts a job.
*   An Installer wins the job with a **Final Bid** of **₹10,000**.
*   The job included a promotional **Travel Tip** of **₹1,000**.
*   The platform charges a **5% commission** to the Installer.
*   The platform charges a **5% platform fee** to the Job Giver.
*   The applicable **GST rate is 18%**.

### **Step 1: Job Giver Funds the Project (Total Payment)**

When the Job Giver awards the job, they pay the **total project cost** into the platform's secure account. This total is composed of the service cost for the installer and the service fee for the platform.

| Description                               | Amount (INR) |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------:|
| Installer's Bid Amount                    |    ₹10,000.00  |
| Travel Tip for Installer                  |     ₹1,000.00  |
| Platform Fee (5% of Bid Amount)           |       ₹500.00  |
| GST on Platform Fee (18% of ₹500)         |        ₹90.00  |
| **Total Paid by Job Giver**               | **₹11,590.00** |

*This entire amount is collected by the platform. The ₹11,000 portion for the installer is held until the job is successfully completed.*

---

### **Step 2: Job Completion & Payouts (The "Split")**

Once the job is marked as "Completed," the platform processes the payouts.

1.  **Payout to the Installer:** The platform calculates the installer's net earnings.
    *   Total Due to Installer: `₹10,000 (Bid) + ₹1,000 (Tip) = ₹11,000`
    *   Platform Commission (deducted from earnings): `5% of ₹10,000 (Bid) = ₹500`
    *   **Final Payout to Installer:** `₹11,000 - ₹500 = **₹10,500.00**`

2.  **Platform Revenue:** The platform retains its revenue from both parties.
    *   Commission from Installer: `₹500.00`
    *   Platform Fee from Job Giver: `₹500.00`
    *   **Total Platform Revenue (pre-GST):** `₹1,000.00`

## 2. The Invoicing Process (Who Invoices Whom?)

Three separate invoicing events happen in this transaction, one for each service rendered.

### **Invoice 1: From Installer to Job Giver (For the Main Service)**

This is the primary invoice for the work done, generated by the platform on behalf of the Installer.

*   **Who issues it?** The **Installer**.
*   **Who receives it?** The **Job Giver**.
*   **What's on it?** The total value of the service provided by the installer.
