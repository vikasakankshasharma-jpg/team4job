# Guide to Invoicing & GST on CCTV Job Connect

This guide explains how invoices are generated on the platform, especially concerning Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is crucial for both Job Givers and Installers to understand these details for proper accounting and tax compliance.

**Disclaimer:** CCTV Job Connect is a marketplace facilitator. We provide the tools to generate compliant invoices based on the data provided. However, the ultimate responsibility for collecting and remitting the correct GST to the government lies with the **Installer** (the service provider) for their services, and with the **Platform** for its commission fees.

## 1. The Complete Financial Workflow: A Detailed Example

To understand the flow of money and invoices, let's use a clear example with specific figures.

**Scenario:**
*   An Installer's final **Bid Amount** is **₹10,000**.
*   The job includes a promotional **Travel Tip** of **₹1,000**.
*   The platform charges a **5% commission** to the Installer.
*   The platform charges a **5% platform fee** to the Job Giver.
*   The applicable **GST rate is 18%**.

### **Step 1: Job Giver Funds the Project (Total Payment)**

When the Job Giver awards the job, they pay the **total project cost** into the platform's secure **Marketplace Settlement account**, powered by Cashfree. This total is composed of the service cost for the installer and the service fee for the platform.

| Description                               | Amount (INR) |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------:|
| Installer's Bid Amount                    |    ₹10,000.00  |
| Travel Tip for Installer                  |     ₹1,000.00  |
| Platform Fee (5% of Bid Amount)           |       ₹500.00  |
| GST on Platform Fee (18% of ₹500)         |        ₹90.00  |
| **Total Paid by Job Giver to Platform**   | **₹11,590.00** |

*This entire amount is collected by the platform. The ₹11,000 portion for the installer is held until the job is successfully completed.*

---

### **Step 2: Job Completion & Payouts (The "Split")**

Once the job is marked as "Completed," the platform processes the payouts using Cashfree's "Easy Split" feature.

1.  **Payout to the Installer:** The platform calculates the installer's net earnings.
    *   Total Due to Installer: `₹10,000 (Bid) + ₹1,000 (Tip) = ₹11,000`
    *   Platform Commission (deducted from earnings): `5% of ₹10,000 (Bid) = ₹500`
    *   **Final Payout to Installer's Bank Account:** `₹11,000 - ₹500 = **₹10,500.00**`

2.  **Platform Revenue:** The platform retains its revenue from both parties.
    *   Commission from Installer: `₹500.00`
    *   Platform Fee from Job Giver: `₹500.00`
    *   **Total Platform Revenue (pre-GST):** `₹1,000.00`

## 2. The Invoicing Process (Who Invoices Whom?)

Three separate invoicing events happen in this transaction, one for each service rendered.

### **Invoice 1: From Installer to Job Giver (For the Main Service)**

This is the primary invoice for the work done, generated by the platform on behalf of the Installer.

*   **Who issues it?** The **Installer**.
*   **Who receives it?** The **Job Giver**.
*   **What's on it?** The total value of the service provided by the installer.

| Description                     | Taxable Amount (INR) |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------:|
| Main Service (Bid Amount)       |          ₹10,000.00  |
| Travel & Convenience Allowance  |           ₹1,000.00  |
| **Subtotal (Taxable Value)**    |          **₹11,000.00**|
| GST @ 18% (Example Rate)        |           ₹1,980.00  |
| **Grand Total**                 |          **₹12,980.00**|

*The Job Giver uses this invoice to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) if they are a registered business.*

---

### **Invoice 2 & 3: From Platform to Users (For Platform Fees)**

The platform provides its services to *both* the Job Giver and the Installer. Therefore, it issues separate invoices to each for the fees it has charged.

#### **Invoice 2: From Platform to Installer**

*   **Who issues it?** **CCTV Job Connect** (The Platform).
*   **Who receives it?** The **Installer**.
*   **What's on it?** The commission fee for finding the job.

| Description               | Taxable Amount (INR) |
| ------------------------- | --------------------:|
| Platform Commission (5%)  |             ₹500.00  |
| GST @ 18%                 |              ₹90.00  |
| **Total Fee**             |             **₹590.00**|

*The Installer uses this invoice to claim ITC on the GST they paid for the platform's service. This is a business expense for the Installer.*

#### **Invoice 3: From Platform to Job Giver**

*   **Who issues it?** **CCTV Job Connect** (The Platform).
*   **Who receives it?** The **Job Giver**.
*   **What's on it?** The platform fee for using the marketplace.

| Description             | Taxable Amount (INR) |
| ----------------------- | --------------------:|
| Platform Fee (5%)       |             ₹500.00  |
| GST @ 18%               |              ₹90.00  |
| **Total Fee**           |             **₹590.00**|

*The Job Giver also uses this invoice to claim ITC on the GST they paid for the platform's service.*

## 3. Important Clarification: Why is the Installer's Payout Different from their Invoice?

This is a common and important question. Let's clarify the flow of money.

*   The **Installer's Invoice** to the Job Giver (Invoice #1) represents the total value of the installation service they provided (`₹11,000 + GST`).
*   The **Installer's Payout** from the platform is their net earnings after their own business expenses (`₹10,500`).

**The payout is different because the Installer is also a customer of the platform.**

Think of it this way:
1.  The Installer earned `₹11,000` from the Job Giver for the installation service.
2.  The Platform provided a service to the Installer (finding the job, providing tools) for a fee of `₹500` (Invoice #2).
3.  Instead of the Installer receiving the full `₹11,000` and then paying the platform back `₹500`, the platform, acting as a settlement agent, simply deducts this fee from the payout for convenience.

**`Installer Payout = (Amount from Job Giver) - (Fee Owed to Platform)`**
**`₹10,500 = (₹11,000) - (₹500)`**

This method is standard practice in marketplaces and ensures all transactions are settled efficiently and transparently.
