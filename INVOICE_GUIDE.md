# Guide to Invoicing & GST on CCTV Job Connect

This guide explains how invoices are generated on the platform, especially concerning Goods and Services Tax (GST). It is crucial for both Job Givers and Installers to understand these details for proper accounting and tax compliance.

**Disclaimer:** CCTV Job Connect is a marketplace facilitator. We provide the tools to generate compliant invoices based on the data provided. However, the ultimate responsibility for collecting and remitting the correct GST to the government lies with the **Installer** (the service provider).

## 1. The Complete Financial Workflow: A Detailed Example

To understand the flow of money and invoices, let's use a clear example.

**Scenario:**
*   A Job Giver posts a job with a **Travel Tip** of **₹1,000**.
*   An Installer wins the job with a **Final Bid** of **₹10,000**.
*   The platform charges a **10% commission** to the Installer.

### **Step 1: Job Giver Funds the Project**

When the Job Giver awards the job, they pay the **total project cost** into the platform's secure account.

| Description             | Amount       |
| ----------------------- | ------------:|
| Installer's Bid Amount  | ₹10,000.00   |
| Travel Tip              |  ₹1,000.00   |
| **Total Paid by Job Giver** | **₹11,000.00** |

*This entire amount is held by the platform until the job is successfully completed.*

---

### **Step 2: Job Completion & Payout**

Once the job is marked as "Completed," the platform processes the payouts.

1.  **Payout to the Installer:** The platform calculates the installer's net earnings.
    *   Total Due to Installer: `₹10,000 (Bid) + ₹1,000 (Tip) = ₹11,000`
    *   Platform Commission: `10% of ₹10,000 (Bid) = ₹1,000`
    *   **Final Payout to Installer:** `₹11,000 - ₹1,000 = **₹10,000.00**`

2.  **Platform Revenue:**
    *   The platform retains its **₹1,000.00** commission.

## 2. The Invoicing Process (Who Invoices Whom?)

There are **two separate invoicing events** that happen in this transaction.

### **Invoice 1: From Installer to Job Giver (For the Main Service)**

This is the primary invoice for the work done. The platform generates this on behalf of the Installer.

*   **Who issues it?** The **Installer**.
*   **Who receives it?** The **Job Giver**.
*   **What's on it?** The total value of the service provided.

| Description                     | Taxable Amount |
| ------------------------------- | -------------: |
| Main Service (Bid Amount)       |    ₹10,000.00  |
| Travel & Convenience Allowance  |     ₹1,000.00  |
| **Subtotal (Taxable Value)**    |    **₹11,000.00**  |
| CGST @ 9% (Example)             |       ₹990.00  |
| SGST @ 9% (Example)             |       ₹990.00  |
| **Grand Total**                 | **₹12,980.00** |

*The Job Giver uses this invoice to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) if they are a registered business.*

### **Invoice 2: From Platform to Installer (For the Commission)**

This is the invoice for the service provided by the platform (i.e., connecting the installer with a job).

*   **Who issues it?** **CCTV Job Connect** (The Platform).
*   **Who receives it?** The **Installer**.
*   **What's on it?** The commission fee charged by the platform.

| Description         | Taxable Amount |
| ------------------- | -------------: |
| Platform Commission |     ₹1,000.00  |
| GST @ 18% (Example) |       ₹180.00  |
| **Total**           |     **₹1,180.00**  |

*The Installer uses this invoice to claim ITC on the GST they paid for the platform's service. This is a business expense for the Installer.*

By structuring the finances and invoicing this way, all transactions are transparent, compliant, and correctly documented for accounting and tax purposes for all three parties involved.
