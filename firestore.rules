/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure authorization based on user roles and relationships, while relaxing data validation to allow for rapid prototyping.
 * It enforces strict ownership and role-based access control, ensuring that users can only access resources they are authorized to view or modify.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /jobs/{jobId}: Stores job postings, including bids, comments, and messages embedded within the job document. Publicly readable, but writes are restricted to the job giver.
 * - /disputes/{disputeId}: Stores dispute records, accessible only to the involved parties and administrators.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction records, accessible only to the involved parties.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Public read access is granted to the `/jobs` collection, but writes are controlled via ownership.
 * - Data validation is minimized to focus on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Job` entity requires a `jobGiver` field to determine ownership for write operations.
